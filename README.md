# ![The EroWrite icon.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thebungler/EroWrite/refs/heads/main/icon.png) EroWrite
 An addon for [Stimuwrite 2](https://thatclowngoddess.itch.io/stimuwrite) which adds buttplug.io support.

Based off of the [Stimuwrite Example Addon](https://github.com/beastly-eve/stimuwrite-example-addon) and leverages [Godot.Buttplug](https://github.com/erodozer/Godot.Buttplug) by [Erodozer](https://github.com/erodozer) for pretty much all of its functionality.

This is the first time I've made anything in Godot, and the first time I have made anything that plays with vibrators. I have not tested things out beyond using a single vibrator in Initface Central, and the addon may not work with multiple devices or unusual ones like strokers. While Godot.Buttplug included options for things like XBox gamepad and Bluetooth LE support, I have not tested these.

Overall, this addon is probably rather crude, but it suffices for my needs. Feel free to make use of it or build upon it, as you'd like.
